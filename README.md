# C/C++ Template
The project is a starter project designed to provide a well-organized and ready-to-use setup for developing C/C++ projects using Visual Studio Code. This template is aimed at helping developers quickly get started with C/C++ development without the hassle of setting up a build system and file hierarchy.

### How to Get Started
Once you've created your repository using this template, you can begin configuring the project and writing code instantly. First, rename the project in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Then, you can start writing code in the `Source` directory. You can also create subdirectories if needed. When you're ready to run your code, simply press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build and compile your project. Afterward, you can run it by pressing `F5`.
