# Typoglycemia
The phenomenon, known as typoglycemia, is the ability to understand words when the first and last letters are stable, but the intermediate letters are scrambled. Your brain puts the letters back into a sequence again.

## How to Download
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/GamerFandor/Typoglycemia/releases) tab here on GitHub and select the executable or installer that you want to download.

If you want to build the app from source code you are going to need some prerequesets:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Clang](https://llvm.org/builds/)
- [Make](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Only on Windows - works as a backend for Clang)
- 
Once you've installed all of these softwares just run the `Build.bat` or the `Build.sh` file. After that you will find the executable in the `Build` directory.

## How to Use It

```

If you installed the .deb package on linux you also can take a look at the man page:
